# Imagine-Make

Context : Imagine & Make was a challenge of 1 week in my university (Centrale Lille) where we were challenged to develop an innovation to be used with the robot from Boston Dynamics to resolve problems in a construction site. So I had the idea to do a machine learning to detect the port of helmets (hard hats) in workers.

To training the IA I used a database from Kaggle, site focus in programming IA, have a lot of databases ready to use,  and validate the model there. After that, I did a script to load the IA and of time in time to apply the IA in images of a folder.
